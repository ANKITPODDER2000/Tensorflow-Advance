# Custom Models

1. Following is an example of a deep and wide network structure.
  * ***False***

2. Consider the following code and check all that are true:
  *  ***The output layers cannot give more than 1 result each.***
  *  ***The init function initializes the MyModel Class objects, as well as the attributes that are inherited from the Model Class.***
  
3. You have learned that Sequential and Functional APIs have their limitations.
    
  How can you build dynamic networks where the architecture changes on the fly, or networks where recursion is used? Check all that are true:
  * ***Using model subclassing***
  * ***Using Sequential API***
  * ***Using Functional API***
  
4. Which one of the following is a false statement regarding model subclassing?
  * ***You cannot introduce a branch structure in the architecture when doing model subclassing.***

5. Consider the following two images:
  * ***You make a loop of Residual Type 2 blocks because you want to reduce the depth of the network (making it less complex of an architecture)***
  * ***Each Residual block has two hidden layers and one add layer in it.***
  * ***When you make a loop of Residual Type 2 blocks, each block could have the same weights.***
