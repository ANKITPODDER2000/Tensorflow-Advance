# AutoGraph

1. Which of the following statements is false about Graph approach?
    * Faster compilation
    * Parallelism
    * ***Easier debugging***
    * Portability
    
2. Which of the following statements is true for tf.cond ?
    * tf.cond is an alternative to using if/else statements in Graphs, as its execution is much faster than if/else statements.
    * ***Graph execution does not support if/else statements. To replicate that effect you use tf.cond***

3. Consider the following code:
    * By adding the decorator, @tf.function, only above the function definition of increment_by_two
    * ***By adding the decorator, @tf.function, above the definitions of both of the functions.***
    * By adding the decorator, @tf.autograph, above the definitions of both of the functions.
    * ***By adding the decorator, @tf.function, only above the function definition of multiple_increment***

4. Function written in Eager mode when converted to Graph accommodates different data types all in one, so you donâ€™t have to define similar functions for different data types.
    * ***True***
    * False

5. Which of the following is the correct syntax to display the auto-generated AutoGraph code if your function name is my_function?
    * tf.autograph.code(my_function)
    * tf.autograph.to_code(my_function)
    * ***tf.autograph.to_code(my_function.python_function)***
    * tf.autograph.code(my_function.python_function)
    
6. Consider the following code, what will be the output?
    * ***6times Hello World***
